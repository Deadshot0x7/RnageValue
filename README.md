# RnageValue
The primary purpose of the "RangeValue" library would be to simplify the process of managing and constraining numerical values within a pre-defined range. This is particularly useful in applications involving sensor data processing, where readings might fluctuate outside expected boundaries, or in controlling actuators where you must maintain output within safe or functional limits.
 
# features 
**1. Easy Range Setting:**

- The library would allow users to easily set minimum and maximum value limits for a particular variable. This could be especially useful for analog sensor readings, which can vary greatly.

**2. Automatic Constrain Function:**

- It would likely offer a method, such as constrain(), to automatically adjust any given value to stay within the set range. If a value is below the minimum, it will be raised to the minimum; if it's above the maximum, it will be lowered to the maximum.
3. **Flexibility**: 
- The library could be designed to work with various data types, such as int, float, or long, making it versatile for different variables.

**4.Ease of Use:**

- Integration with Arduino IDE would be straightforward, involving simple inclusion of the library and minimal code to implement its functionality.
**5. Error Handling:** 
- It might also offer error handling or warnings if values being constrained are consistently at the extremes, indicating potential issues with the sensors or logic.
